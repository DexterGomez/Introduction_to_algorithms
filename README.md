# Algorithm
an algorithm  is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

# Control structures of an algorithm
## Selectives structures
Also known as a conditional structure, a selection structure is an algorithm feature that performs different processes based on whether a boolean condition is true or false. Selection structures use relational operators to test conditions. There are different types of selection structures that can be used to achieve different outcomes. 
- If you want your algorithm to do something if a condition is true, but do nothing if that condition is false, then you should use an **if-end** structure.
- If you want your algorithm to do something if a condition is true and do something different if it is false, then you should use an **if-else** structure.
-If you want to test multiple conditions, then you can include an elseif structure within an if-end or if-else structure.

## Repetitive structures
The repetitive structures are methods to do some actions many time as the conditional says, is very useful to save code and solve some special problems which need an specific group of actions.
The are three diferents repetive structures (also known as loops):
- **While** loop: there is conditional in the first part and then the actions of the loop, while the conditional is true the actions would be repeated many times until break down the contidional.
- **For** loop: in this case the structure has three parts before the actions: first there is a iterator number, then there is a contional and finally there is an action which change the iterator.
-**Do-while** loop: is like the "while" loop but there are the actions first and then the condiontal causing actions to the executed at least once.

## Nested structures
This structures occurs when a structure has anothers structures into it making possible to solve more complex problems. An example of a nested structure is an **if** conditional into a **while** loop.

# Types of algorithm representations
## Flow chart
A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.
The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.
## Pseudo code
Is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. It typically omits details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations and language-specific code. The programming language is augmented with natural language description details, where convenient, or with compact mathematical notation. The purpose of using pseudocode is that it is easier for people to understand than conventional programming language code, and that it is an efficient and environment-independent description of the key principles of an algorithm. 

# Types of computational data
- Numeric: the numerical data are the integers and decimals abiable to use in the computation process.
- Logic: this type alow only two options, true or false, and is often used in the conditionals from a selective or repetitive structure.
- String and characters: allow to use letters and sentences of words as a type of data, also could be has numbers but in this case they woud be used as part of a sentence and not like a Numeric data
- Arrangements: is a group (list) of other computational data, it could has Numeric, Logic, String and also Arrangements types into an arragement.

# Representation of computational data
- Variable: the data can be changed during the ejecution as long as use the same data type.
- Constant: in this case the data are not aviable to be changed again.
